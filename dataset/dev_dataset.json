            "The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes, adjustments due to the TCJA partially offset by tax benefits associated with restricted stock, and the increase of available foreign tax credits.",
            "During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid income taxes of $77.3 million, $90.7 million and $88.8 million, respectively, net of refunds.",

            "For the December 31, 2018 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible.",
            "For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined with discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.",
            "Additionally, these investments are categorized as NAV investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value.",
            "In accordance with ASU No.2011-12 “Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested.",

            "Other types of investments include real estate funds and private equity funds that follow several different investment strategies.",

            "Discount rates of 3.90% per year for participants in pay status and 4.11% per year for participants with deferred benefits were selected by the Plan Sponsor to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination annuity purchases.",

            "To determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination lump sum payments, the expected future cash flows for lump sum eligible participants, determined with the IRC 417(e) Mortality Table for 2019, were discounted with the IRC 417(e) segment interest rates for the month of November 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88%).",
