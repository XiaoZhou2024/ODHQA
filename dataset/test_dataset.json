            "The decrease was due primarily to a gross margin decline driven by lower than expected revenue, contractual rate declines on ongoing contracts, a lower resource utilization rate and additional costs associated with certain contract deliverable delays.",

            "Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.7 percentage points in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue, the effect of which was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin.",

            "These decreases were partially offset by a lower mix of lower-margin professional services revenue.",
