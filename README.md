# ODHQA: An Open-Domain Hybrid Data Numerical Reasoning Question Answering Dataset  

## Introduction  

**ODHQA** (Open-Domain Hybrid Data Numerical Reasoning Question Answering Dataset) is a benchmark dataset for open-domain Question Answering (QA) tasks with a focus on numerical reasoning involving hybrid data types. It aims to encourage the development and evaluation of QA systems capable of understanding and reasoning over mixed context (e.g., text, tables, numbers).
